### Chapter 12

##### Six sigma charts
Chart examples are on page 305 of the textbook

* Flow Charts
  * Used in the define stage of a product
* Run charts
  * Depict trends over time and hepl in the define stage
* Pareto charts
	* These charts help to break down a problem into the relative contributions of its components, based on the idea that 80% of problems are caused by 20% of causes
* Checksheets
	* These are basic forms that help standardize data collections.
* Fishbone (aka Cause and Effect Diagram)
	* To construct, start with a why? question. Why are pizza deliveries late on Friday and Saturday nights?
	* The rest consists of lines drawn across the page, attached to the problem statement, and several lines or "bones" coming out vertically from the main line.
